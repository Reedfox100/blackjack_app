# Welcome to Blackjack!
This is a simple application made in my first attempt at Rust allowing you to practice blackjack! It is completely text-based and using some *special* ASCII art,
looks as pretty as a text-based Blackjack table can look.
Take the time to test it out, have some fun with local friends (it is multiplayer up to 4 at a table), and hone your Blackjack skills!

## Details:
* Up to 4 Players (Not including the house)
* Runnable and playable all in a Command Line

## Future Changes:
* Correct splitting
* Shoe changes
* UI??


## Notes:
#1: There is no betting. This is meant for practice, so focusing on money should not be a concern.

#2: The current shoe size is 1 deck (52 cards), but will be expanded later on to a multitude of sizes for better practice when in a competitive environment or a casino.

#3: Splitting will be added next, given time.


## Structure
The current structure of the program includes some help from a Rust crate known as [deckofcards](https://docs.rs/deckofcards/latest/deckofcards/).
This wonderful crate has simple logic that could have been re-produced in my project, but if we have the resources, why not save some time and use an already-created deck!
The following is a layout of the program:
